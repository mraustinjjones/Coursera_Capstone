    "My Capstone Project aims at providing information for upcoming graduates to better decide where they'd like to work upon graduation. My audience is comprised of upcoming college graduates who are working in the investing realm. I'm focusing on those students who are considering moving to New York City and Toronto, the finance capitals of the U.S. and Canada, respectively. I will be investigating the characteristics of venues in neighborhoods around both cities finance hubs to provide potential movers more insight into the two cities. I will conduct analysis based on the types of venues within the two areas, assuming that the workers will earn the same real pay in either city."

I will pair this data with longitudinal and latitudinal values for the neighborhoods in each city to be more specific as to where these graduates may want to live. The longitudinal and latitudinal data was found in the previous lab for this capstone."
