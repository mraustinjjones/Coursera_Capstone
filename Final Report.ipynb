    "My Capstone Project aims at providing information for upcoming graduates to better decide where they'd like to work upon graduation. My audience is comprised of upcoming college graduates who are working in the investing realm. I'm focusing on those students who are considering moving to New York City and Toronto, the finance capitals of the U.S. and Canada, respectively. I will be investigating the characteristics of venues in neighborhoods around both cities finance hubs to provide potential movers more insight into the two cities. I will conduct analysis based on the types of venues within the two areas, assuming that the workers will earn the same real pay in either city."

The longitudinal and latitudinal data was found in the previous lab for this capstone."

    "To begin with Manhattan, one has a wide variety as to what type of neighborhood they would like to be in. Hamilton Height, East Harlem, and Manhattan Valley would all be fantastic places for someone who enjoys going out to eat, as many of their common venues are restaurants, pizza places, bakeries, etc. Beyond these, the neighborhoods shown in purple all show great diversity in the types on venues. For example, Lincoln Square’s most common venues include a theater, concert hall, Café, Park, Indie Movie Theater, as well as restaurants. For someone who doesn’t want to get out, Stuyvesant Town may be a good destination. It has a Park, Bar, Playground, Heliport, Basketball Court, Baseball Field, and Harbor/Marina in its ten most common venues. What this really boils down to is that Manhattan offers a fantastic diversity in the venues of each neighborhood, giving people moving a wide variety in what sort of things to do they want around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toronto also offers great variety in the types on neighborhoods one can be in. From a farmer’s market in Berczy Park, to a Skate Park in Eastern, to a Sculpture Garden in Bathurst Quay. One difference is that in Toronto many of the venues are fairly uniform across the clusters. Most are dominated by restaurants and may have one non-food or drink venue. This isn’t a bad thing by any means, but no neighborhoods like Stuyvesant Town came up dominated by activity driven venues."
